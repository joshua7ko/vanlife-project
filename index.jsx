   * made the `HostVanInfo.jsx`, `HostVanPricing.jsx` and
   * `HostVanPhotos.jsx` files for you, but they're empty.

   * Don't forget: you'll need to use a special tool from

   * eventually the navbar we build) on the page while going
   * from nested route to nested route. This will require some
   * slight changes to HostVanDetail.jsx
   * 
   * Since we don't have the navbar yet, you can test them
   * by manually navigating to e.g. /host/vans/1/pricing.
