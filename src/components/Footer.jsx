/**
 * Challenge: Add the footer to the site! Make a separate Footer component
 * in the components folder, and just use this as the markup:
 * 
 * <footer>&#169; 2022 #VANLIFE</footer>
 * 
 * I'm mostly wanting to test your ability to find where the footer would
 * be added, and don't care too much about getting the styling correct.
 * But if you feel you need extra CSS practice, feel free to do the styling
 * as well!
